## Photo upload

## Steps

1. **Retrieve Photos:** Use the `/photos` endpoint to learn how to retrieve data from a database. Observe the list of photos stored in the database.

2. **Upload a Picture:** Utilize the `/upload` endpoint to upload your own picture to the server. 

3. **AWS Integration:** Explore the AWS S3 integration in the API. Understand how AWS services can be used to store and serve files in a cloud environment.

By doing this backend project, I enhanced my knowledge of web development, database interaction, and cloud storage with Amazon Web Services. It's a practical and educational tool to help me learn and explore these concepts in a real-world context.

This flow outlines the process of handling file uploads from a frontend client to a FastAPI backend, including size and type validation, and subsequently storing the file in an AWS S3 bucket.
